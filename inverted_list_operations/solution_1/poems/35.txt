ìWhen I was just as far as I could walk
From here to-day,
There was an hour
All still
When leaning with my head against a flower
I heard you talk.
Donít say I didnít, for I heard you sayññ
You spoke from that flower on the window sillññ
Do you remember what it was you said?î
ìFirst tell me what it was you thought you heard.
ìHaving found the flower and driven a bee away,
I leaned my head,
And holding by the stalk,
I listened and I thought I caught the wordññ
What was it? Did you call me by my name?
Or did you sayññ
Someone said ëComeíññI heard it as I bowed.î
ìI may have thought as much, but not aloud.î
ìWell, so I came.î
