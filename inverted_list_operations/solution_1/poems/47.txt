I didnít like the way he went away.
That smile! It never came of being gay.
Still he smiledññdid you see him?ññI was sure!
Perhaps because we gave him only bread
And the wretch knew from that that we were poor.
Perhaps because he let us give instead
Of seizing from us as he might have seized.
Perhaps he mocked at us for being wed,
Or being very young (and he was pleased
To have a vision of us old and dead).
I wonder how far down the road heís got.
Heís watching from the woods as like as not.
