well wa dry beside door go pail across field behind house seek brook still run both excuse go because autumn eve wa fair though chill because field brook wood run meet moon slowly dawn behind tree barren bough without leave without bird without breeze on within wood pus like some hide us moon ready run hide new laughter find us soon lay stay hand listen ere dare look hush join make hear know hear brook note single place slender tinel fall make drop float pool like pearl silver blade
